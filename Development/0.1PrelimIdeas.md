3. food tracker app with no calorie information displayed to user
   - uses https://rapidapi.com/edamam/api/edamam-food-and-grocery-database/details
   - user can track their food and based on their weight management goals and/or nutrition goals the app might make suggestions ( %200 percent of carbs? try eating less bread!)
   - would be complicated for suggestions...
4. myBar 
   - using https://rapidapi.com/thecocktaildb/api/the-cocktail-db
     - has freemium pricing, but worth it for the start.
     - 'bartender' users can add their own cocktails
     - users have their own cabinet and app can suggest drinks by ingredients they already have
